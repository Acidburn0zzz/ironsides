    The parties agree:

        \ Overview \
        These points give a loose summary of some of the important parts of this agreement, with references to specific parts of this agreement:

            \\
            This agreement covers <Your> purchase of shares of common stock in the <Company>. The <Company> agrees to sell <You> stock in {Shares}, and <You> agree to buy the stock 

            # (( if allIP begin ))

            with property you assign to the <Company> 

            # (( end ))

            # (( if allCash begin ))

            with cash 

            # (( end ))

            # (( if cashAndIP begin ))

            with cash and property you assign to the <Company> 

            #(( end ))

            in {Purchase Price}.

            # (( unless allCash begin ))

            <You> assign the property to the <Company> in {Property Assignment}.

            \\  If <You> are married, <Your> spouse signs this agreement and related documents with <You>, since they may have rights in property acquired during marriage.

            \\
            <Your> stock is subject to "vesting" under {Vesting}. That means <You> give the <Company> a right to buy <Your> shares back from <You> in {Repurchase Option}. As <Your> stock vests under {Vesting Schedule}, that right applies to less of <Your> stock. In specific situations, vesting happens faster, or "accelerates", under {Acceleration}.

            \\
            To prevent <Your> shares falling into unfamiliar or unwelcome hands against your will, <You> give the <Company> the right to buy them instead in {Right to Purchase on Involuntary Transfer}.

            \\
            To help ensure that any future IPO goes well, <You> promise to agree to hold off selling <Your> shares immediately after the <Company> goes public in {Lock-Up}.

            \\
            Stock sales are highly regulated. <You> make statements in {Statements about Securities and Tax} about <Your> relationship to the <Company>, <Your> plans for <Your> shares, and legal rules that limit how and when <You> might sell <Your> shares that are very important under securities laws.

            \\
            Tax laws also apply to <Your> purchase. <You> make several statements about tax in {Statements about Securities and Tax}. Since <You> have decided to make an 83(b) election, <You> make a statements about <Your> choice and <Your> responsibility to file with the IRS in {Section 83(b) Election}.

            \\
            To protect the <Company>'s rights and prevent administrative mishaps, <You> and the <Company> agree to process and legal mechanisms that affect <Your> stock in {Escrow}, {Restrictive Legends and Stop-Transfer Notices}, and {Shareholder Notices}.

            <You> understand that <Covered Securities> have not been registered under the <Securities Act>, that the <Company> is instead relying on an exemption from registration, and that the exemption depends on the honesty and genuineness of <Your> investment intent, as expressed in this agreement, and other factors.

            <You> understand that <Covered Securities> must be held indefinitely unless they are registered under the <Securities Act> or an exemption from registration becomes available. <You> understand that the <Company> is under no obligation to register any securities.

            \\
            <You> are familiar with Rule 144 under the <Securities Act>, which allows limited public resale of some "restricted securities" in non-public offerings on certain conditions, among them that the issuer be subject to reporting requirements of the <Exchange Act>, that holders hold securities for given time periods before resale, volume restrictions, and brokered transaction requirements. <You> understand the <Company> gives no assurance that any <Covered Securities> will ever be eligible for resale under Rule 144.

            \\
            <You> understand that if any requirement of Rule 144 is not satisfied, legal resale of <Covered Securities> will require registration under the <Securities Act>, compliance with Regulation A, or some other registration exemption. <You> understand that, despite the fact that Rule 144 is not exclusive, the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission has opined that those proposing to sell private placement securities other than in a registered offering and other than under Rule 144 will have a substantial burden of proof in establishing that an exemption from registration is available, and that such sellers and their respective brokers who participate in such transactions do so at their own risk.

        \ Restrictive Legends and Stop-Transfer Notices \

            \ Legends \
            Any stock certificate or, in the case of uncertificated securities, any notice of issuance, for the <Covered Securities>, will bear these legends, in addition to any legends required by law:

                \ Unregistered Securities Legend \
                "The referenced securities have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, and have been acquired for investment and not with a view to, or in connection with, sale or distribution. No sale or distribution is permitted without an effective registration statement for the securities or an opinion of legal counsel, satisfactory to the company, that such registration is not required under the Securities Act of 1933."

                \ Transfer Restriction Legend \
                "The referenced securities may be transferred only under an agreement between the company and the stockholder, a copy of which is on file with the Secretary of the company, who will provide a copy on request free of charge."

            \ Stop-Transfer Notices \
            <You> agree that, to ensure compliance with the restrictions of this agreement, the <Company> may issue appropriate "stop transfer" instructions to its transfer agent, if any, and that, if the <Company> transfers its own securities, it may make appropriate notations to the same effect in its own stock ledger and list of shareholders (""Stop-Transfer Notices"").

            \ Refusal to Transfer \
            The <Company> will not be required to do any of these:

                \\
                transfer on its books any <Covered Securities> that have been sold or otherwise transferred in violation of any of the provisions of this agreement

                \\
                treat any purchaser or other transferee who received <Covered Securities> in violation of this agreement as the owner of those <Covered Securities>, or to accord them rights to vote or receive dividends

            \ Legend and Notice Removal \
            <Covered Securities> will no longer be subject to the legend specified in {Transfer Restriction Legend}, and the <Company> will remove <Stop-Transfer Notices> made under this agreement, when all these have occurred:

                \\
                The <Right of First Refusal> has terminated.

                \\
                The <Company> has fully exercised the <Repurchase Option>, or the <Repurchase Option> has expired.

                \\
                The restrictions of {Lock-Up} and any <Lock-Up Agreement> have expired.

            When a <Holder>'s <Covered Securities> are no longer subject to the legend, the <Holder> may request that the <Company> issue a new stock certificate (or notice of issuance, for uncertificated shares) for those <Covered Securities> without the legend, and the <Company> shall do so.

        \ Shareholder Notices \
        <You> acknowledge that the <Covered Securities> are issued and will be held subject to all provisions of {Restrictive Legends and Stop-Transfer Notices} and the <Company>'s <Governing Documents>. Copies of the <Governing Documents> are on file with the Secretary of the <Company>. The <Company> will provide a statement of the powers, designations, preferences, and relative, participating, optional, or other special rights of each class or series of stock of the <Company> and the qualifications, limitations, or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights, as well as a copy of that statement, to any stockholder on request and without charge at the principal office of the <Company>. <You> acknowledge that the provisions of {Restrictive Legends and Stop-Transfer Notices} will constitute the notices required by Sections 151(f) and 202(a) of the Delaware General Corporation Law (""DGCL""). <You> waive the requirement of <DGCL> section 151(f) that it receive the written notice provided for in <DGCL> sections 151(f) and 202(a) within a reasonable time after the issuance of <Covered Securities>.

                <You> understand that <You> may elect to be taxed when <Your Shares> are purchased, rather than when they <Vest>, by filing an election under Section 83(b) of the <Tax Code> (an ""83(b) Election"") with the <IRS> within 30 days from the date of purchase.

                \\
                <You> understands that even if the fair market value of <Your Shares> on the date of this agreement equals the <Total Purchase Price>, an <83(b) Election> must be made to avoid income under Section 83(a) in the future.

                \\
                <You> understands that failure to file an <83(b) Election> on time may have severe tax consequences for <You>.

                <You> understand that an additional copy of any <83(b) Election> should be filed with <Your> federal income tax return for the calendar year encompassing the date of this agreement.

                <You> acknowledge that this is only a summary of the effect of United States federal income taxation on purchase of <Your Shares>. The summary is incomplete, and will not help <You> avoid any tax penalties.

                <You> have consulted, and has been fully advised by, <Your> own tax adviser regarding an <83(b) Election> and other tax laws and consequences, or has knowingly decided not to consult a tax adviser.

                \\
                <You> acknowledge that neither the <Company> nor any <Subsidiary>, <Affiliate>, <Parent>, or representative of the <Company> has made or will be accountable for any statement or advice to <You> about the tax consequences of <Your> purchase of <Your Shares> or <Your> decision to make an <83(b) Election>.

            \!!
            <You>, not the <Company> or any other, will be solely responsible for appropriately filing an <83(b) Election> with the <IRS>, even if <You> ask the <Company> or any other file on <Your> behalf.

            \\
            <You> shall sign and deliver to the <Company> with this agreement a copy of the acknowledgment and statement attached as {83(b) Acknowledgment and Statement} and, if <You> decide to make an <83(b) Election>, a copy of the <83(b) Election>, attached as {Section 83(b) Election}.
