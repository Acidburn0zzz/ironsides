    \ About these Bylaws \

        \\
        These are the ""Bylaws"" of [Company Name], the ""Company"".

        \\
        The <Company> was formed under the laws of the state of Delaware. As a result, Delaware law governs the ""Internal Affairs"" of the <Company>. How the <Company> is organized, how the <Company> makes business decisions, rights and responsibilities of those involved with the <Company>, and disputes between them are examples of <Internal Affairs>.

        \\
        The most important Delaware law governing Delaware corporations is the Delaware General Corporation Law, or ""Corporation Law"" for short. Under the <Corporation Law>, the most important document setting out rules for the <Company> is its ""Certificate of Incorporation"". The <Certificate of Incorporation> was filed with the Secretary of State of Delaware to form the <Company>. Changes to the <Certificate of Incorporation> require stockholder votes and additional filings with the Secretary of State.

        \\
        The <Company> may put any rules that do not contradict its <Certificate of Incorporation> or the <Corporation Law> in these <Bylaws>. If there is ever a dispute about the <Company>'s rules, courts will try to read the <Certificate of Incorporation> and <Bylaws> so they make sense together. If that is not possible, the <Certificate of Incorporation> will trump <Bylaws>. As described in {Changing Bylaws}, the <Certificate of Incorporation> may give the <Company>'s board of directors, the ""Board"", power to change <Bylaws>.

        \\
        In addition to the <Certificate of Incorporation> and <Bylaws>, the <Corporation Law> provides a number of rules that apply when neither the <Certificate of Incorporation> nor <Bylaws> address a topic. These are called ""Default Rules"". Still other rules in the <Corporation Law>, and possibly in other states' laws, apply to the <Internal Affairs> of the <Company> no matter what. These are ""Mandatory Rules"". The <Certificate of Incorporation> and <Bylaws>, as well as <Default Rules> and <Mandatory Rules> as they change over time, all add up to the rules for the <Internal Affairs> of the <Company>.

            Any stockholder of record, in person or by attorney or other agent, shall, upon written demand under oath stating the purpose of inspection, have the right during the usual hours for business to inspect for any proper purpose the corporation's stock ledger, a list of its stockholders, and its other books and records and to make copies or extracts of those records. A proper purpose shall mean a purpose reasonably related to such person's interest as a stockholder.

        \ Inspection By Directors \
        Any director shall have the right to examine the corporation's stock ledger, a list of its stockholders, and its other books and records for a purpose reasonably related to his or her position as a director. The Court of Chancery is hereby vested with the exclusive jurisdiction to determine whether a director is entitled to the inspection sought. The Court may summarily order the corporation to permit the director to inspect any and all books and records, the stock ledger, and the stock list and to make copies or extracts of those records. The Court may, in its discretion, prescribe any limitations or conditions with reference to the inspection, or award such other and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper.

    \ General Matters \

        \ Checks \
        From time to time, the Board of Directors shall determine by resolution which person or persons may sign or endorse all checks, drafts, other orders for payment of money, notes or other evidences of debt that are issued in the name of or payable to the corporation, and only the persons so authorized shall sign or endorse those instruments.

            \\

Any or all of the signatures on any certificate may be a facsimile or electronic signature. In case any officer, transfer agent or registrar who has signed or whose facsimile or electronic signature has been placed upon a certificate has ceased to be such officer, transfer agent or registrar before such certificate is issued, it may be issued by the corporation with the same effect as if he or she were such officer, transfer agent or registrar at the date of issue.

            \\
            Within a reasonable time after the issuance or transfer of uncertificated stock and upon the request of a stockholder, the corporation shall send to the record owner of that uncertificated stock a written notice that shall state the name of the corporation, that the corporation is organized under the laws of Delaware, the name of the stockholder, the number and class (and the designation of the series, if any) of the shares, and any restrictions on the transfer or registration of such shares of stock imposed by the corporation's certificate of incorporation, these bylaws, any agreement among stockholders or any agreement between stockholders and the corporation.

            \\
            The corporation may issue the whole or any part of its shares as partly paid and subject to call for the remainder of the consideration to be paid. Upon the face or back of each stock certificate (if any) issued to represent any such partly paid shares, or upon the books and records of the corporation in the case of uncertificated partly paid shares, the total amount of the consideration to be paid for those shares and the amount paid on that total shall be stated. Upon the declaration of any dividend on fully paid shares, the corporation shall declare a dividend upon partly paid shares of the same class, but only upon the basis of the percentage of the consideration actually paid on those partly paid shares.

        \ Special Designation On Certificates and Notices of Issuance \
        If the corporation is authorized to issue more than one class of stock or more than one series of any class, then the powers, the designations, the preferences, and the relative, participating, optional or other special rights of each class of stock or series of stock and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights shall be stated in full or summarized on the face or back of the certificate that the corporation shall issue to represent such class or series of stock or the notice of issuance to the record owner of uncertificated stock; provided, however, that, except as otherwise provided in Section 202 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware, in lieu of the those requirements there may be stated on the face or back of the certificate that the corporation shall issue to represent such class or series of stock or the notice of issuance to the record owner of uncertificated stock, or the purchase agreement for such stock a statement that the corporation will furnish without charge to each stockholder who so requests the powers, the designations, the preferences, and the relative, participating, optional or other special rights of each class of stock or series of stock and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights.

        \ Lost Certificates \
        Except as provided in this {Lost Certificates}, no new certificates for shares shall be issued to replace a previously issued certificate unless the latter is surrendered to the corporation and cancelled at the same time. The corporation may issue a new certificate of stock or notice of uncertificated stock in the place of any certificate previously issued by it, alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed, and the corporation may require the owner of the lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, or the owner's legal representative, to give the corporation a bond sufficient to indemnify it against any claim that may be made against it on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of any such certificate or the issuance of such new certificate or uncertificated shares.

        \ Construction; Definitions \
        Unless the context requires otherwise, the general provisions, rules of construction, and definitions in the Delaware General Corporation Law shall govern the construction of these bylaws. Without limiting the generality of this provision, the singular number includes the plural, the plural number includes the singular, and the term "person" includes both a corporation and a natural person.
