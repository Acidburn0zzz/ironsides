    \ About these Bylaws \

        \\
        These are the ""Bylaws"" of [Company Name], the ""Company"".

        \\
        The <Company> was formed under the laws of the state of Delaware. As a result, Delaware law governs the ""Internal Affairs"" of the <Company>. How the <Company> is organized, how the <Company> makes business decisions, rights and responsibilities of those involved with the <Company>, and disputes between them are examples of <Internal Affairs>.

        \\
        The most important Delaware law governing Delaware corporations is the Delaware General Corporation Law, or ""Corporation Law"" for short. Under the <Corporation Law>, the most important document setting out rules for the <Company> is its ""Certificate of Incorporation"". The <Certificate of Incorporation> was filed with the Secretary of State of Delaware to form the <Company>. Changes to the <Certificate of Incorporation> require stockholder votes and additional filings with the Secretary of State.

        \\
        The <Company> may put any rules that do not contradict its <Certificate of Incorporation> or the <Corporation Law> in these <Bylaws>. If there is ever a dispute about the <Company>'s rules, courts will try to read the <Certificate of Incorporation> and <Bylaws> so they make sense together. If that is not possible, the <Certificate of Incorporation> will trump <Bylaws>. As described in {Changing Bylaws}, the <Certificate of Incorporation> may give the <Company>'s board of directors, the ""Board"", power to change <Bylaws>.

        \\
        In addition to the <Certificate of Incorporation> and <Bylaws>, the <Corporation Law> provides a number of rules that apply when neither the <Certificate of Incorporation> nor <Bylaws> address a topic. These are called ""Default Rules"". Still other rules in the <Corporation Law>, and possibly in other states' laws, apply to the <Internal Affairs> of the <Company> no matter what. These are ""Mandatory Rules"". The <Certificate of Incorporation> and <Bylaws>, as well as <Default Rules> and <Mandatory Rules> as they change over time, all add up to the rules for the <Internal Affairs> of the <Company>.
