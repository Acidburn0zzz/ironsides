                # {{^singleTrigger}}

                \\ ""Acceleration Event"" means any of the following that happens in connection with or following a <Change of Control>:

                    \\ <Purchaser>'s <Continuous Service Status> terminates, other than as a result of <Purchaser>'s death or <Disability>, and the <Company> determines in good faith that there was no <Good Reason to Terminate>.

                    \\ <Purchaser> resigns as follows:
                        \\ <Purchaser> gives written notice to the <Company> of a <Good Reason to Resign> within 60 calendar days of when it happens (""Resignation Notice""),
                        \\ the <Company> does not act to remove the <Good Reason to Resign> within 30 calendar days of receiving <Resignation Notice>,
                        \\ <Purchaser> resigns effective no later than 60 calendar days after giving <Resignation Notice>, and

                \ Accelerated Vesting \ [Acceleration Percentage] of then <Unvested Shares> (""Accelerated Shares""), rounded up to the nearest whole share, will <Vest> on any <Acceleration Event>. In case of an <Asset Sale>, if the acquirer of the <Company>'s assets does not agree to assume this <Agreement>, or to substitute an equal award or right for this <Agreement>, and <Purchaser> transfers <Purchaser>'s employment to the acquirer in connection with the <Asset Sale>, then <Accelerated Shares> will <Vest> immediately before, and contingent on, the consummation of the <Asset Sale>. Otherwise, <Accelerated Shares> will <Vest> immediately before the date of the <Acceleration Event>.

            \ Repurchase Option Terms \

                \\ The exercise price of the <Repurchase Option> will be the <Original Price Per Share>, adjusted for any stock splits, stock dividends, and the like, multiplied by the number of <Unvested Shares> for which the <Repurchase Option> is exercised (the ""Repurchase Price"").

                \\ The <Repurchase Option> will expire at 23:59 San Francisco time on the date [Repurchase Option Days] calendar days after the date of <Termination> (the ""Repurchase Option Expiration Date"").

                \\ The <Company> may exercise the <Repurchase Option> at any time before the <Repurchase Option Expiration Date>.

                \\ Unless the <Company> gives <Purchaser> notice that it does not intend to exercise its <Repurchase Option> for some or all <Unvested Shares> before the <Repurchase Option Expiration Date>, the <Company> will be deemed to exercise the <Repurchase Option> for all <Unvested Shares> on the <Repurchase Option Expiration Date> (""Automatic Repurchase""). The <Company> may give <Purchaser> notice that <Automatic Repurchase> will occur as of any earlier date, or for only some part of the <Unvested Shares>. On <Automatic Repurchase>, the <Company> will become the legal and beneficial owner of the <Unvested Shares> for which the <Repurchase Option> is exercised, will have all rights and interest in and related to those <Unvested Shares>, and will have the right to transfer them to its own name without further <Purchaser> action.

                \\ The <Company> shall pay the <Repurchase Price> by <Check and Cancelled Debt>. If <Purchaser> is indebted to the <Company> on <Automatic Repurchase> and the <Company> does not otherwise pay the <Repurchase Price>, an amount of <Purchaser>'s debt equal to the <Repurchase Price> will be deemed canceled as of the date of <Automatic Repurchase>.

        \ Right of First Refusal \ Subject to {Exception for Family Transfers}:

            \\ The <Company> will have a right of first refusal to purchase any <Covered Securities> (""Right of First Refusal""). Neither <Purchaser> nor any other holder of <Covered Securities> subject to this <Agreement> (""Holder"") shall sell or otherwise transfer <Covered Securities>, for a price, by gift, by operation of law, or otherwise, except under {Exercise of Right of First Refusal} or {Holder's Right to Transfer}.

            \ Notice of Proposed Transfer \ Each <Holder> shall give the <Company> notice of any intent to sell or otherwise transfer <Covered Securities> (""Proposed Transfer Notice""). The <Holder> shall state in the <Proposed Transfer Notice>:

                \\ the name of each proposed transferee (""Proposed Transferee"");

                \\ the number and type of <Covered Securities> to be transferred to each <Proposed Transferee> (""Proposed Transfer Securities"");

If the <Transfer Purchase Price> consists of no legal "consideration" (for example, in the case of a gift), the purchase price will be the <Fair Market Value> of the <Covered Securities> as of the date of purchase. If the <Transfer Purchase Price> includes non-cash property, the cash value of the non-cash property will be its <Fair Market Value> as of the date of purchase.

            \ Payment \ The <Company> shall pay the <Transfer Purchase Price> by <Check and Cancelled Debt> within 60 calendar days of receipt of <Proposed Transfer Notice>.

            \ Holder's Right to Transfer \

                \\ A <Holder> may sell or otherwise transfer any unpurchased <Proposed Transfer Securities>, subject to all the following conditions:

                    \\ The <Proposed Transfer Securities> are not purchased by the <Company> under {Exercise of Right of First Refusal}.

                    \\ The <Proposed Transfer Securities> are sold to the <Proposed Transferee> on the <Proposed Transfer Terms> and for no less than the <Transfer Purchase Price>.

                    \\ The transfer is consummated before 23:59 San Francisco time on the date 120 calendar days after the <Company> receives <Proposed Transfer Notice> (""Transfer Deadline"").

                    \\ The <Proposed Transferee> agrees in writing that {Limits on Transfer} will continue to apply to the <Proposed Transfer Securities>.

                    \\ The transfer complies with securities laws, and if the <Company>, in consultation with legal counsel, requires a legal opinion that the transfer complies with securities laws, <Holder> provides delivers such an opinion to the <Company> before transferring.

                \\ If <Proposed Transfer Securities> described in <Proposed Transfer Notice> are not transferred to a <Proposed Transferee> before their <Transfer Deadline>, but the <Holder> still intends to sell the <Proposed Transfer Securities>, or whenever a <Holder> proposes price or other terms more favorable to a <Proposed Transferee>, the <Holder> shall give new <Proposed Transfer Notice>, and {Right of First Refusal} shall apply to that proposed transfer as if the new <Proposed Transfer Notice> were the first <Proposed Transfer Notice> for the transfer.

            \ Exception for Family Transfers \ Any <Family Transfer> will be exempt from {Right of First Refusal}. Recipients of <Covered Securities> by <Family Transfer> will receive and hold transferred <Covered Securities> subject to, and there will be no further transfer of such <Covered Securities> except under, {Limits on Transfer}.

        \ Company's Right to Purchase on Involuntary Transfer \

            \\ Any <Holder> shall give the Secretary of the <Company> prompt notice of any <Involuntary Transfer> (""Involuntary Transfer Notice"").

            \\ on any <Involuntary Transfer>, the <Company> will have an irrevocable and exclusive option (an ""Involuntary Transfer Option"") to repurchase all or any portion of the <Covered Securities> transferred.

            \\ The exercise price of an <Involuntary Transfer Option> will be the <Fair Market Value> of the <Covered Securities> on the date of the <Involuntary Transfer>.

            \\ An <Involuntary Transfer Option> will expire at 23:59 San Francisco time on the date 30 calendar days after the date corresponding <Involuntary Transfer Notice> was received.

            \\ The <Company> may exercise an <Involuntary Transfer Option> any time before its expiration date.

        \ Assignment of Company Purchase Rights \ The <Company> may assign all or part of any <Company> right to purchase <Covered Securities>, such as the <Repurchase Option>, <Right of First Refusal>, and <Involuntary Transfer Option>, for any number of <Covered Securities> and any proposed transfer, to any number of other parties.

        \ Termination of Company Purchase Rights \ The <Right of First Refusal> and any <Involuntary Transfer Option> will terminate on the first <Initial Public Offering> or <Acquisition by a Public Company>.

        # TODO check FINRA rules
        # TODO double-check parenthetical (except for those being registered)
        \ Lock-up Agreement \ If requested by the <Company> or the underwriters in connection with an <Initial Public Offering>, <Purchaser> shall not sell, short sell, loan, grant any option to purchase, or otherwise dispose of any securities of the <Company>, regardless of how <Purchaser> acquired them (except for those being registered) without the prior written consent of the <Company> or the underwriters, for 180 days from the effective date of the registration statement, plus any additional period required by FINRA rules. If requested by the <Company> or the underwriters, <Purchaser> shall enter into an agreement requested by the underwriters that reflects that restriction (a ""Lock-Up Agreement"").

        \ Escrow of Unvested Shares \

            \\ To facilitate enforcement of {Limits on Transfer}, <Purchaser> shall deliver a stock power in the form of {Stock Power} signed by <Purchaser> and <Purchaser>'s spouse (if required for transfer), in blank, as well as stock certificates for the <Shares>, if any, to the Secretary of the <Company> or the Secretary's designee as escrow holder (""Escrow Holder""). <Escrow Holder> will hold the stock power, <Shares>, and any stock certificates in escrow, and to take all actions and make transfer and releases required under this <Agreement>. <Purchaser> acknowledges that the <Escrow Holder> is irrevocably appointed escrow holder with the these authorities, and that the appointment is an important reason <Company> is willing to enter into this <Agreement>.

            \\ <Escrow Holder> will not be liable to any party to this <Agreement> (or to any other party). The <Escrow Holder> may rely on any letter, notice, or other document with a purportedly genuine signature, and may resign at any time. If the <Escrow Holder> resigns, the <Board> may appoint a new new escrow holder.

        \ Purchaser Statements about Securities and Tax \ <Purchaser> states that all the following are true:

            \\ <Purchaser> is aware of the <Company>'s business affairs and financial condition and has enough information about the <Company> to make an informed and knowledgeable decision to purchase the <Shares>. <Purchaser> is purchasing the <Shares> only for investment and for <Purchaser>'s own account, not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, any "distribution" of <Covered Securities> under the <Securities Act> or state law. <Purchaser> does not intend to transfer any <Covered Securities>.

            \\ <Purchaser> understands that sales of securities like the <Shares> and other <Covered Securities> are regulated by complex state and federal laws, such as the <Securities Act>, <Exchange Act>, and related rules. <Purchaser> understands that illegal sales of securities carry severe civil and criminal penalties.

            \\ <Purchaser> understands that <Covered Securities> have not been registered under the <Securities Act>, that the <Company> is instead relying on an exemption from registration, and that the exemption depends on the honesty and genuineness of <Purchaser>'s investment intent, as expressed in this <Agreement>, and other factors.

            \\ <Purchaser> understands that <Covered Securities> must be held indefinitely unless they are registered under the <Securities Act> or an exemption from registration becomes available. <Purchaser> understands that the <Company> is under no obligation to register any securities.

            \\ <Purchaser> is familiar with Rule 144 under the <Securities Act>, which allows limited public resale of some "restricted securities" in non-public offerings on certain conditions, such as that the issuer be subject to reporting requirements of the <Exchange Act>, that holders hold securities for given time periods before resale, volume restrictions, and brokered transaction requirements. <Purchaser> understands the <Company> gives no assurance that any <Covered Securities> will ever be eligible for resale under Rule 144.

            \\ <Purchaser> understands that if any requirement of Rule 144 is not satisfied, legal resale of <Covered Securities> will require registration under the <Securities Act>, compliance with Regulation A, or some other registration exemption. <Purchaser> understands that, despite the fact that Rule 144 is not exclusive, the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission has opined that those proposing to sell private placement securities other than in a registered offering and other than under Rule 144 will have a substantial burden of proof in establishing that an exemption from registration is available, and that such sellers and their respective brokers who participate in such transactions do so at their own risk.

            \\ <Purchaser> has reviewed, and is not subject to any of, the "Bad Actor" disqualifications of Rule 506(d)(1)(i) through (viii) under the <Securities Act>.

            \\ <Purchaser> understands that <Purchaser> may suffer adverse tax consequences as a result of <Purchaser>'s purchase or disposition of <Covered Securities>. <Purchaser> has consulted with all the tax advisers <Purchaser> deems advisable in connection with the purchase or disposition of the <Shares>. <Purchaser> is not relying on the <Company> for any tax advice.

        \ Restrictive Legends and Stop-Transfer Notices \

            \ Legends \ Any stock certificate or, in the case of uncertificated securities, any notice of issuance, for the <Covered Securities>, will bear the following legends, in addition to any legends required by law:

                \ Unregistered Securities Legend \ "The referenced securities have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, and have been acquired for investment and not with a view to, or in connection with, sale or distribution. No sale or distribution is permitted without an effective registration statement for the securities or an opinion of legal counsel, satisfactory to the company, that such registration is not required under the Securities Act of 1933."

                \ Transfer Restriction Legend \ "The referenced securities may be transferred only in accordance with an agreement between the company and the stockholder, a copy of which is on file with the Secretary of the company, who will provide a copy on request free of charge."

            \ Stop-Transfer Notices \ <Purchaser> agrees that, to ensure compliance with the restrictions of <Agreement>, the <Company> may issue appropriate "stop transfer" instructions to its transfer agent, if any, and that, if the <Company> transfers its own securities, it may make appropriate notations to the same effect in its own stock ledger and list of shareholders (""Stop-Transfer Notices"").

            \ Refusal to Transfer \ The <Company> will not be required to:

                \\ transfer on its books any <Covered Securities> that have been sold or otherwise transferred in violation of any of the provisions of this <Agreement>; or

                \\ treat any purchaser or other transferee who received <Covered Securities> in violation of this <Agreement> as the owner of those <Covered Securities>, or to accord them rights to vote or receive dividends.

            \ Legend and Notice Removal \ <Covered Securities> will no longer be subject to the legend specified in {Transfer Restriction Legend}, and the <Company> will remove <Stop-Transfer Notices> made under this <Agreement>, when all the following have occurred:

                \\ The <Right of First Refusal> has terminated.

                \\ The <Company> has fully exercised the <Repurchase Option>, or the <Repurchase Option> has expired.

                \\ The restrictions of {Lock-up Agreement} and any <Lock-Up Agreement> have expired.

            When a <Holder>'s <Covered Securities> are no longer subject to the legend, the <Holder> may request that the <Company> issue a new stock certificate (or notice of issuance, for uncertificated shares) for those <Covered Securities> without the legend, and the <Company> shall do so.

        \ Required Notices \ <Purchaser> acknowledges that the <Covered Securities> are issued and will be held subject to all the provisions of {Restrictive Legends and Stop-Transfer Notices} and the <Company>'s <Governing Documents>. Copies of the <Governing Documents> are on file with the Secretary of the <Company>. The <Company> will provide a statement of the powers, designations, preferences, and relative, participating, optional, or other special rights of each class or series of stock of the <Company> and the qualifications, limitations, or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights, as well as a copy of that statement, to any stockholder on request and without charge at the principal office of the <Company>. <Purchaser> acknowledges that the provisions of {Restrictive Legends and Stop-Transfer Notices} will constitute the notices required by Sections 151(f) and 202(a) of the Delaware General Corporation Law (""DGCL""). <Purchaser> waives the requirement of <DGCL> section 151(f) that it receive the written notice provided for in <DGCL> sections 151(f) and 202(a) within a reasonable time after the issuance of <Covered Securities>.

        \ Section 83(b) Election \

            \ Purchaser Statements about 83(b) \ <Purchaser> states that all the following are true:

                \\ <Purchaser> understands that Section 83(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the ""Tax Code"") taxes the difference between the amount paid for the <Shares> and the fair market value of the <Covered Securities> as of the date they <Vest> as ordinary income.

                \\ <Purchaser> understands that <Purchaser> may elect to be taxed when the <Shares> are purchased, rather than when they <Vest>, by filing an election under Section 83(b) of the <Tax Code> (an ""83(b) Election"") with the <IRS> within 30 days from the date of purchase.

                \\ <Purchaser> understands that even if the fair market value of the <Shares> on the <Purchase Date> equals the <Total Purchase Price>, an <83(b) Election> must be made to avoid income under Section 83(a) in the future.

                \\ <Purchaser> understands that failure to file an <83(b) Election> on time may have severe tax consequences for <Purchaser>.

                \\ <Purchaser> understands that an additional copy of any <83(b) Election> should be filed with <Purchaser>'s federal income tax return for the calendar year encompassing the <Purchase Date>.

                \\ <Purchaser> acknowledges that this is only a summary of the effect of United States federal income taxation on purchase of the <Shares>. The summary is incomplete, and will not help <Purchaser> avoid any tax penalties.

                \\ <Purchaser> acknowledges that the <Company> has directed <Purchaser> to seek independent advice about the <Tax Code>, other tax laws that apply where <Purchaser> lives, and the tax consequences of <Purchaser>'s death.

                \\ <Purchaser> has consulted, and has been fully advised by, <Purchaser>'s own tax adviser regarding an <83(b) Election> and other tax laws and consequences, or has knowingly decided not to consult a tax adviser.

                \\ <Purchaser> acknowledges that neither the <Company> nor any <Subsidiary>, <Affiliate>, <Parent>, or representative of the <Company> has made or will be accountable for any statement or advice to <Purchaser> about the tax consequences of <Purchaser>'s purchase of the <Shares> or <Purchaser>'s decision to make an <83(b) Election>.

            \!! <Purchaser>, not the <Company> or any other, will be solely responsible for appropriately filing an <83(b) Election> with the <IRS>, even if <Purchaser> asks the <Company> or any other file on <Purchaser>'s behalf.

            \\ <Purchaser> shall sign and deliver to the <Company> with this <Agreement> a copy of the acknowledgment and statement attached as {83(b) Acknowledgment and Statement} and, if <Purchaser> decides to make an <83(b) Election>, a copy of the <83(b) Election>, attached as {83(b) Election}.
