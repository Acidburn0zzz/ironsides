This Common Stock Purchase Agreement (this ""Agreement"") is made as of [Effective Date] between [Company Name], a Delaware corporation (the ""Company""), and [Name] (""Purchaser"").

\\ The parties agree:

    Stock Sale \\

        Purchase and Sale \\ Subject to the terms and conditions of this <Agreement>, on the date of the this <Agreement> or on another date agreed on by the parties (the ""Purchase Date""), the <Company> shall issue and sell to <Purchaser>, and <Purchaser> shall purchase from the <Company>, [Number of Shares] shares of the <Company>'s Common Stock (the ""Shares"").

        Purchase Price \\ On the <Purchase Date>, <Purchaser> shall pay [Purchase Price] per share for the <Shares> (the ""Original Price Per Share""), for a total purchase price of [Total Purchase Price] (the ""Total Purchase Price""). <Purchaser> shall pay the <Total Purchase Price> by entering into the agreement attached as {IP Assignment Form}, by which <Purchaser> assigns assets to the <Company>.

        Record of Ownership \\ On the <Purchase Date>, <Company> shall list the <Shares> in <Purchaser>'s name as of the <Purchase Date> in the <Company>'s stock ledger and list of stockholders, or with the authorized transfer of the <Company> if it has one. On <Purchaser>'s request, the <Company> shall give <Purchaser> a written notice of issuance for the <Shares>.

    Limits on Transfer \\

        \\ As used elsewhere in this <Agreement>, ""Covered Securities"" means:

            \\ the <Shares>;

            \\ all securities received in connection with <Covered Securities> as a result of stock dividends or splits;

            \\ all securities received in replacement of <Covered Securities> in a recapitalization, merger, reorganization, exchange or the like; and

            \\ all new, substituted or additional securities or other property to which holders of <Covered Securities> are entitled as owners of those securities.

        \\ <Purchaser> shall not assign, encumber, or dispose of any interest in <Covered Securities> except to the extent allowed by, and in compliance with, both this <Agreement> and securities laws.

    Vesting \\

        Repurchase Option \\ On <Termination>, the <Company> will have an irrevocable and exclusive option (the ""Repurchase Option"") to repurchase all or any portion of the <Shares> held by <Purchaser> as of <Termination> that have not yet been released from the <Repurchase Option> (""Unvested Shares""). [Shares Subject to Vesting] of the <Shares> will start subject to the <Repurchase Option> (the ""Vesting Shares"").

        Vesting Schedule \\ Subject to {Vesting Schedule Stops on Termination} and {Acceleration}, <Vesting Shares> will release from the <Repurchase Option> (""Vest"") as follows:
            \\ [Cliff Shares] <Vesting Shares> will <Vest> on [Cliff Date] (the ""Cliff"").
            \\ An additional [Vesting Increment] <Vesting Shares> will <Vest> on the [Vesting Day] day of each month (or the last day of the month, if there is no such day) after the <Cliff>, until all <Vesting Shares> <Vest>.

        Vesting Schedule Stops on Termination \\ No <Vesting Shares> will <Vest> under {Vesting Schedule} on or after the date of <Termination>.

        Acceleration \\ If <Purchaser> is terminated without <Cause> by the <Company> (or a successor, if appropriate) or resigns for <Good Reason> in connection with or following the consummation of a <Change of Control>, then the vesting of the <Unvested Shares> will accelerate such that the <Repurchase Option> in {Vesting} will lapse for [Acceleration Percentage] of the <Unvested Shares>. The lapse of repurchase rights provided for in the previous sentence will occur immediately before the <Termination Date>. In the case of a sale of all or substantially all the <Company>'s assets other than to an <Excluded Entity>, if the acquirer of the <Company>'s assets does not agree to assume this <Agreement>, or to substitute an equivalent award or right for this <Agreement>, and <Purchaser> transfers his employment to such acquirer in connection with such asset sale transaction, then any acceleration of vesting that would otherwise occur on <Purchaser>'s termination will occur immediately before, and contingent on, the consummation of such asset sale transaction. As used in this <Agreement>, ""Change of Control"" means

            \\ a sale of all or substantially all the <Company>'s assets other than to an <Excluded Entity>,

            \\ a merger, consolidation or other capital reorganization or business combination transaction of the <Company> with or into another corporation, limited liability company or other entity other than an <Excluded Entity>, or

            \\ the consummation of a transaction, or series of related transactions, in which any "person" (as such term is used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the <Exchange Act>) becomes the "beneficial owner" (as defined in Rule 13d-3 of the <Exchange Act>), directly or indirectly, of all the <Company>'s then outstanding voting securities. However, a transaction will not constitute a <Change of Control> if its purpose is to

                \\ change the jurisdiction of the <Company>'s incorporation,

                \\ create a holding company that will be owned in substantially the same proportions by the those who hold the <Company>'s securities immediately before such transaction, or

                \\ obtain funding for the <Company> in a financing that is approved by the <Company>'s Board of Directors.

            An ""Excluded Entity"" means a corporation, limited liability company or other entity of which the holders of voting capital stock of the <Company> outstanding immediately before such transaction are the direct or indirect holders of voting securities representing at least a majority of the votes entitled to be cast by all of such corporation's, limited liability company's or other entity's voting securities outstanding immediately after such transaction. As used in this <Agreement>, ""Cause"" for the <Company> (or a successor, if appropriate) to terminate <Purchaser>'s employment will exist under the following conditions

                \\ <Purchaser>'s willful and continued failure to substantially perform <Purchaser>'s duties to the <Company> after there has been delivered to <Purchaser> by the <Company>'s Board of Directors a written demand for substantial performance and chance to cure which states in detail the specific respects in which the <Company>'s Board of Directors believes that <Purchaser> has not substantially performed <Purchaser>'s duties;

                \\ <Purchaser> having committed willful fraud, willful misconduct, dishonesty or other intentional action in any such case which is materially injurious to the <Company>;

                \\ <Purchaser>'s having been convicted of, or having plead guilty or no contest to, any crime that results in, or is reasonably expected to result in material harm to the business or reputation of the <Company>; or

                \\ <Purchaser>'s material breach of any material written agreement between <Purchaser> and the <Company>, such as any Confidential Information and Invention Assignment Agreement with the <Company>, and <Purchaser>'s failure to cure such breach within 30 days after receiving written notice of that material breach.

            For purposes of clarity, a termination without <Cause> does not include any termination that occurs as a result of <Purchaser>'s death or <Disability>. The determination of whether <Purchaser>'s <Continuous Service Status> has been terminated for <Cause> will be made in good faith by the <Company> and will be final and binding on <Purchaser>. The definition of <Cause> does not in any way limit the <Company>'s ability to terminate <Purchaser>'s employment or consulting relationship at any time, and the term <Company> will be interpreted to include any <Subsidiary>, <Parent>, <Affiliate>, or any successor to such a <Subsidiary>, <Parent> or <Affiliate>, if appropriate.

            \\ As used in this <Agreement>, ""Good Reason"" means <Purchaser>'s resignation due to the occurrence of any of the following conditions which occurs without <Purchaser>'s written consent:

                \\ a reduction of <Purchaser>'s then current base salary by 10% or more unless such reduction is part of a generalized salary reduction affecting similarly situated employees;

                \\ a change in <Purchaser>'s position with the <Company> that materially reduces <Purchaser>'s duties, level of authority or responsibility; or

                \\ the <Company> conditions <Purchaser>'s continued service with the <Company> on <Purchaser>'s being transferred to a site of employment that would increase <Purchaser>'s one-way commute by more than 35 miles from <Purchaser>'s then principal residence. 

            \\ In order for <Purchaser> to resign for <Good Reason>, <Purchaser> must provide written notice to the <Company> of the existence of the <Good Reason> condition within 60 days of the initial existence of such <Good Reason> condition. On receipt of such notice, the <Company> will have 30 days during which it may remedy the <Good Reason> condition and not be required to provide for the vesting acceleration described in this <Agreement> as a result of such proposed resignation. If the <Good Reason> condition is not remedied within such 30-day period, <Purchaser> may resign based on the <Good Reason> condition specified in the notice effective no later than 30 days following the expiration of the 30-day cure period. If <Purchaser> is a <Director> but not an <Employee> or <Consultant> of the <Company> (or a successor, if appropriate) on consummation of the <Change of Control> and <Purchaser> is removed from, or is not reelected to, the Board of Directors of the <Company> (or a successor, as appropriate) in connection with or following the consummation of a <Change of Control>, the vesting of any <Unvested Shares> will accelerate such that the <Repurchase Option> will lapse to the same extent as if <Purchaser> had been terminated without <Cause> as described above.

        Option Terms \\

             Exercise Price \\ The exercise price of the <Repurchase Option> will be <Original Price Per Share>, adjusted for any stock splits, stock dividends, and the like, time the number of <Unvested Shares> for which the <Repurchase Option> is exercised (the ""Repurchase Option Exercise Price"").

             Expiration \\ The <Repurchase Option> will expire at 23:59 San Francisco time on the date that is [Repurchase Option Days] calendar days after the date of <Termination> (the ""Repurchase Option Expiration Date"").

            Automatic Exercise \\ Unless the <Company> gives <Purchaser> notice that it does not intend to exercise its <Repurchase Option> for some or all <Unvested Shares> prior to the <Repurchase Option Expiration Date> (a ""No-Repurchase Notice""), the <Company> will be deemed to exercise the <Repurchase Option> for all <Unvested Shares> on the <Repurchase Option Expiration Date> (""Automatic Exercise""). The <Company> may give <Purchaser> notice that <Automatic Exercise> will occur as of any earlier date, or for only some part of the <Unvested Shares>. On <Automatic Exercise>, the <Company> will become the legal and beneficial owner of the <Unvested Shares> for which the <Repurchase Option> is exercised, will have all rights and interest in and related to those <Unvested Shares>, and will have the right to transfer them to its own name without further <Purchaser> action.

            Payment of Exercise Price \\

                Payment Methods \\ The <Company> shall pay the <Repurchase Option Exercise Price> in one of these ways:

                    \\ The <Company> may deliver a check for the <Repurchase Option Exercise Price> to <Purchaser>.

                    \\ If <Purchaser> is indebted to the <Company>, the <Company> may cancel <Purchaser>'s debt in the amount of the <Repurchase Option Exercise Price>.

                    \\ The <Company> may pay by check and cancellation of debt that add up to the <Repurchase Option Exercise Price>.

                Automatic Debt Cancellation \\ If <Purchaser> is indebted to the <Company> on <Automatic Exercise> and the <Company> does not otherwise pay the <Repurchase Option Exercise Price>, an amount of <Purchaser>'s debt equal to the <Repurchase Option Exercise Price> will be deemed canceled as of the date of <Automatic Exercise>.

    Right of First Refusal \\ Subject to {Exception for Some Family Transfers}:

        \\ Before any <Covered Securities> held by <Purchaser> or any transferee of <Purchaser> (either being sometimes referred to in this <Agreement> as the ""Holder"") may be sold or otherwise transferred (including transfer by gift or operation of law), the <Company> or its assignee(s) will have a right of first refusal to purchase the <Covered Securities> on the terms and conditions of this {Right of First Refusal} (the ""Right of First Refusal""), which the <Company> may either

            \\ exercise its <Right of First Refusal> and purchase the <Covered Securities> as forth in {Right of First Refusal} or

            \\ reject to exercise its <Right of First Refusal> and let the transfer of the <Covered Securities> to the <Proposed Transferee>.

        Notice of Proposed Transfer \\ The <Holder> of the <Covered Securities> shall deliver to the <Company> a written notice (the ""Notice"") stating:

            \\ the <Holder>'s intent to sell or otherwise transfer such <Covered Securities>;

            \\ the name of each proposed purchaser or other transferee (""Proposed Transferee"");

            \\ the number of <Covered Securities> to be transferred to each <Proposed Transferee>;

            \\ the terms and conditions of each proposed sale or transfer, including the purchase price for such <Covered Securities> (the ""Transfer Purchase Price""); and

            \\ the <Holder>'s offer shall offer to the <Company> or its assignee(s) to purchase the <Covered Securities> at the <Transfer Purchase Price> and on the same terms (or terms as similar as reasonably possible).

        Exercise of Right of First Refusal \\ At any time within 30 days after receipt of the <Notice>, the <Company> and/or its assignee(s) may, by giving written notice to the <Holder>, elect to purchase any or all the <Covered Securities> proposed to be transferred to any one or more of the <Proposed Transferee>s, at the <Transfer Purchase Price>. If the <Transfer Purchase Price> consists of no legal "consideration" (for example, in the case of a gift), the purchase price will be the fair market value of the <Covered Securities> as determined in good faith by the <Company>'s Board of Directors. If the <Transfer Purchase Price> includes non-cash property, the cash value of the non-cash property will be determined by the <Company>'s Board of Directors in good faith.

        Payment \\ The <Company> or its assignee(s) shall pay the <Transfer Purchase Price>, at their election, in cash (by check), by cancellation of all or a portion of any outstanding debt, or by any combination of cash and cancellation of debt within 60 days after receipt of the <Notice> or in the manner and when agreed by the <Company> (or its assignee(s)) and the <Holder>.

        Holder's Right to Transfer \\

            \\ The <Holder> may sell or otherwise transfer any unpurchased <Covered Securities>, subject to all the following conditions:

                \\ The <Covered Securities> are not purchased by the <Company> and/or its assignee(s) under {Right of First Refusal}.

                \\ The <Covered Securities> are sold to the <Proposed Transferee> at the <Transfer Purchase Price> or a higher price.

                \\ The transfer is consummated within 120 days after the date of <Notice>.

                \\ The transfer is effected in compliance with securities laws.

                \\ The <Proposed Transferee> agrees in writing that the provisions of {Limits on Transfer} will continue to apply to the <Covered Securities> in the hands of such <Proposed Transferee>.

                \\ If the <Company>, in consultation with its legal counsel, so requires, <Holder> provides an opinion of legal counsel evidencing compliance with securities laws.

            \\ If the <Covered Securities> described in the <Notice> are not transferred to the <Proposed Transferee> within such period, or if the <Holder> proposes to change the price or other terms to make them more favorable to the <Proposed Transferee>, a new <Notice> shall be given to the <Company>, and the <Company> and/or its assignees shall again be offered the <Right of First Refusal> before any <Covered Securities> held by the <Holder> may be sold or otherwise transferred.

        Exception for Some Family Transfers \\ The transfer of any or all the <Covered Securities> during <Purchaser>'s lifetime or on <Purchaser>'s death by will or intestacy to <Purchaser>'s <Immediate Family> or to a trust for the benefit of <Purchaser> or <Purchaser>'s <Immediate Family> will be exempt from the provisions of {Right of First Refusal}. ""Immediate Family"" as used in this <Agreement> means lineal descendant or antecedent, spouse (or spouse's antecedents), father, mother, brother or sister (or their descendants), stepchild (or their antecedents or descendants), aunt or uncle (or their antecedents or descendants), brother-in-law or sister-in-law (or their antecedents or descendants) and includes adoptive relationships, or any person sharing <Purchaser>'s household (other than a tenant or an employee). In such case, the transferee or other recipient will receive and hold the <Covered Securities> so transferred subject to the provisions of {Limits on Transfer}, and there will be no further transfer of such <Covered Securities> except as permitted under {Limits on Transfer}.

    Company's Right to Purchase on Involuntary Transfer \\ If, at any time after the date of this <Agreement>, of any transfer by operation of law or other involuntary transfer (including divorce or intestate transfer on death, but excluding transfer on death by will (to any transferee) or a transfer to <Immediate Family> as described by {Exception for Some Family Transfers}) of all or a portion of the <Covered Securities> by the record holder of those <Covered Securities>, the <Company> will have the right to purchase any or all the <Covered Securities> transferred at the fair market value of the <Covered Securities> on the date of transfer (as determined by the <Company> in its sole discretion). On such a transfer, the <Holder> shall promptly notify the Secretary of the <Company> of such transfer. The right to purchase such <Covered Securities> shall be provided to the <Company> for a period of 30 days following receipt by the <Company> of written notice from the <Holder>.

    Assignment \\ The right of the <Company> to purchase any part of the <Covered Securities> may be assigned in whole or in part to any holder or holders of capital stock of the <Company> or other people or organizations.

    Restrictions Binding on Transferees \\ All transferees of <Covered Securities> or any interest in the <Covered Securities> will receive and hold such <Covered Securities> or interest subject to the provisions of this <Agreement>, including, as applicable, the <Repurchase Option>. Any sale or transfer of the <Covered Securities> will be void unless the provisions of this <Agreement> are satisfied.

    Termination of Rights \\ The <Right of First Refusal> granted the <Company> by {Right of First Refusal} and the right to repurchase the <Covered Securities> on involuntary transfer granted the <Company> by {Company's Right to Purchase on Involuntary Transfer} will terminate on the first sale of Common Stock of the <Company> to the general public pursuant to a registration statement filed with and declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Act of 1933 (the ""Securities Act"") (other than a registration statement relating solely to the issuance of Common Stock pursuant to a business combination or an employee incentive or benefit plan) or any transfer or conversion of <Covered Securities> made pursuant to a statutory merger or statutory consolidation of the <Company> with or into another corporation or corporations if the common stock of the surviving corporation or any direct or indirect parent corporation of the other corporation or corporations is registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ""Exchange Act"").

    Lock-up Agreement \\ If so requested by the <Company> or the underwriters in connection with the initial public offering of the <Company>'s securities registered under the <Securities Act>, <Purchaser> shall not sell, make any short sale of, loan, grant any option for the purchase of, or otherwise dispose of any securities of the <Company> however or whenever acquired (except for those being registered) without the prior written consent of the <Company> or such underwriters, as the case may be, for 180 days from the effective date of the registration statement, plus such additional period, to the extent required by FINRA rules, up to a maximum of 216 days from the effective date of the registration statement, and <Purchaser> shall enter into any agreement reflecting that restriction requested by the underwriters at the time of such offering.

    Escrow of Unvested Shares \\ For purposes of facilitating the enforcement of the provisions of {Limits on Transfer}, <Purchaser> agrees to deliver a Stock Power in the form attached to this <Agreement> as {Stock Power} signed by <Purchaser> and <Purchaser>'s spouse (if required for transfer), in blank, and such stock certificate(s), if any, to the Secretary of the <Company>, or the Secretary's designee, to hold such <Shares> (and stock certificate(s), if any) and Stock Power in escrow and to take all such actions and to effectuate all such transfers and/or releases as are required under this <Agreement>. <Purchaser> hereby acknowledges that the Secretary of the <Company>, or the Secretary's designee, is so appointed as the escrow holder with the these authorities as a material inducement to make this <Agreement> and that appointment is coupled with an interest and is accordingly irrevocable. <Purchaser> agrees that escrow holder will not be liable to any party to this <Agreement> (or to any other party). The escrow holder may rely on any letter, notice or other document with a signature purported to be genuine and may resign at any time. <Purchaser> agrees that if the Secretary of the <Company>, or the Secretary's designee, resigns as escrow holder for any reason, the Board of Directors of the <Company> will have the power to appoint a successor to serve as escrow holder under this <Agreement>.

    Investment and Taxation Representations \\ In connection with the purchase of the <Shares>, <Purchaser> represents to the <Company> the following:

        \\ <Purchaser> is aware of the <Company>'s business affairs and financial condition and has acquired enough information about the <Company> to reach an informed and knowledgeable decision to acquire the <Shares>. <Purchaser> is purchasing the <Shares> for investment for <Purchaser>'s own account only and not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, any "distribution" of the <Shares> within the meaning of the <Securities Act> or under state law. <Purchaser> does not have any present intent to transfer the <Shares> to any other person or entity.

        \\ <Purchaser> understands that the <Shares> have not been registered under the <Securities Act> by reason of a specific exemption therefrom, which exemption depends on, among other things, the honest and genuine nature of <Purchaser>'s investment intent as expressed in this <Agreement>.

        \\ <Purchaser> further acknowledges and understands that the securities must be held indefinitely unless they are later registered under the <Securities Act> or an exemption from such registration is available. <Purchaser> further acknowledges and understands that the <Company> is under no obligation to register the securities.

        Rule 144 \\ <Purchaser> is familiar with the provisions of Rule 144, promulgated under the <Securities Act>, which, in substance, allows limited public resale of "restricted securities" acquired, directly or indirectly, from the issuer of the securities (or from an affiliate of such issuer), in a non-public offering subject to the satisfaction of some conditions. <Purchaser> understands that the <Company> provides no assurances about whether he or she will be able to resell any or all the <Shares> under Rule 144, which rule requires, among other things, that the <Company> be subject to the reporting requirements of the <Exchange Act>, that resales of securities take place only after the holder of the <Shares> has held the <Shares> for given time periods, and under some circumstances, that resales of securities be limited in volume and take place only via brokered transactions.

        Burden of Proof \\ <Purchaser> further understands that if all the requirements of Rule 144 are not satisfied, registration under the <Securities Act>, compliance with Regulation A, or some other registration exemption will be required; and that, despite the fact that Rule 144 is not exclusive, the Staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission has expressed its opinion that those proposing to sell private placement securities other than in a registered offering and otherwise than under Rule 144 will have a substantial burden of proof in establishing that an exemption from registration is available for such offers or sales, and that such sellers and their respective brokers who participate in such transactions do so at their own risk.

        \\ <Purchaser> represents that <Purchaser> is not subject to any of the "Bad Actor" disqualifications described in Rule 506(d)(1)(i) to (viii) under the <Securities Act> (attached as {Rule 506(d)(1)(i) to (viii) under the Securities Act of 1933}).

        \\ <Purchaser> understands that <Purchaser> may suffer adverse tax consequences as a result of <Purchaser>'s purchase or disposition of the <Shares>. <Purchaser> represents that <Purchaser> has consulted any tax consultants <Purchaser> deems advisable in connection with the purchase or disposition of the <Shares> and that <Purchaser> is not relying on the <Company> for any tax advice.

    Restrictive Legends and Stop-Transfer Orders \\

        Legends \\ Any stock certificate or, in the case of uncertificated securities, any notice of issuance, for the <Covered Securities>, will bear the following legends (as well as any legends required by state and federal corporate and securities laws):

            Unregistered Securities Legend !! "The securities referenced herein have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, and have been acquired for investment and not with a view to, or in connection with, the sale or distribution thereof. No such sale or distribution may be effected without an effective registration statement related thereto or an opinion of counsel in a form satisfactory to the company that such registration is not required under the Securities Act of 1933."

            Transfer Restriction Legend !! "The securities referenced herein may be transferred only in accordance with the terms of an agreement between the company and the stockholder, a copy of which is on file with and may be obtained from the secretary of the company at no charge."

        Stop-Transfer Notices \\ <Purchaser> agrees that, to ensure compliance with the restrictions referred to in this <Agreement>, the <Company> may issue appropriate "stop transfer" instructions to its transfer agent, if any, and that, if the <Company> transfers its own securities, it may make appropriate notations to the same effect in its own stock ledger and list of shareholders.

        Refusal to Transfer \\ The <Company> will not be required

            \\ to transfer on its books any <Covered Securities> that have been sold or otherwise transferred in violation of any of the provisions of this <Agreement> or

            \\ to treat as owner of such <Covered Securities> or to accord the right to vote or pay dividends to any purchaser or other transferee to whom such <Covered Securities> will have been so transferred.

        Legend and Notice Removal \\ When all the following events have occurred, the <Covered Securities> then held by <Purchaser> will no longer be subject to the legend specified in {Transfer Restriction Legend} and the <Company> will remove any stop-transfer notices associated with the transfer restrictions imposed by this <Agreement>:

            \\ the termination of the <Right of First Refusal>;

            \\ the expiration or exercise in full of the <Repurchase Option>; and

            \\ the expiration or termination of the lock-up provisions of {Lock-up Agreement} (and of any agreement entered under {Lock-up Agreement}).

        After such time and on <Purchaser>'s request, a new stock certificate or, in the case of uncertificated securities, notice of issuance, for the remaining <Covered Securities>, shall be issued without the legend specified in {Transfer Restriction Legend} and delivered to <Purchaser>.

    Required Notices \\ <Purchaser> acknowledges that the <Covered Securities> are issued and will be held subject to all the provisions of {Restrictive Legends and Stop-Transfer Orders}, the Certificate of Incorporation and the Bylaws of the <Company> and any amendments to the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the <Company>, copies of which are on file at the principal office of the <Company>. A statement of all the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions granted to or imposed on the respective classes and/or series of shares of stock of the <Company> and on the holders of those classes and/or series may be obtained by any stockholder on request and without charge, at the principal office of the <Company>, and the <Company> will furnish any stockholder, on request and without charge, a copy of such statement. <Purchaser> acknowledges that the provisions of {Restrictive Legends and Stop-Transfer Orders} will constitute the notices required by Sections 151(f) and 202(a) of the Delaware General Corporation Law and the <Purchaser> hereby expressly waives the requirement of Section 151(f) of the Delaware General Corporation Law that it receive the written notice provided for in Sections 151(f) and 202(a) of the Delaware General Corporation Law within a reasonable time after the issuance of the <Covered Securities>.

    No Employment Rights \\ Nothing in this <Agreement> will affect in any manner whatsoever the right or power of the <Company>, or a parent, subsidiary or <Affiliate> of the <Company>, to terminate <Purchaser>'s employment or consulting relationship, for any reason, with or without cause.

    Section 83(b) Election \\

        \\ <Purchaser> understands that Section 83(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the ""Code""), taxes as ordinary income the difference between the amount paid for the <Shares> and the fair market value of the <Shares> as of the date any <restriction>s on the <Shares> lapse. In this context, ""restriction"" means the right of the <Company> to purchase the <Shares> back under the <Repurchase Option> described in {Vesting}. <Purchaser> understands that <Purchaser> may elect to be taxed when the <Shares> are purchased, rather than when and as the <Repurchase Option> expires, by filing an election under Section 83(b) (an ""83(b) Election"") of the <Code> with the Internal Revenue Service within 30 days from the date of purchase. Even if the fair market value of the <Shares> on entry into this <Agreement> equals the amount paid for the <Shares>, the election must be made to avoid income under Section 83(a) in the future. <Purchaser> understands that failure to file such an election on time may have bad tax consequences for <Purchaser>. <Purchaser> further understands that an additional copy of such election form should be filed with <Purchaser>'s federal income tax return for the calendar year in which the date of this <Agreement> falls. <Purchaser> acknowledges that this is only a summary of the effect of United States federal income taxation with respect to purchase of the <Shares> under this <Agreement>, does not purport to be complete, and is not intended or written to be used, and cannot be used, for the purposes of avoiding taxpayer penalties. <Purchaser> further acknowledges that the <Company> has directed <Purchaser> to seek independent advice regarding the provisions of the <Code>, the income tax laws of any municipality, state or foreign country in which <Purchaser> may reside, and the tax consequences of <Purchaser>'s death, and <Purchaser> has consulted, and has been fully advised by, <Purchaser>'s own tax advisor regarding such tax laws and tax consequences or has knowingly chosen not to consult such a tax advisor. <Purchaser> further acknowledges that neither the <Company> nor any subsidiary or representative of the <Company> has made any warranty or representation to <Purchaser> with respect to the tax consequences of <Purchaser>'s purchase of the <Shares> or of the making or failure to make an <83(b) Election>.

    !! <Purchaser> (and not the <Company>, its agents or any other person) will be solely responsible for appropriately filing such form with the IRS, even if <Purchaser> requests the <Company>, its agents or any other person make this filing on <Purchaser>'s behalf.

    \\ <Purchaser> agrees that <Purchaser> will sign and deliver to the <Company> with this <Agreement> a copy of the acknowledgment and statement attached as {Acknowledgment and Statement of Decision Regarding Section 83(b) Election} and, if <Purchaser> decides to make an <83(b) Election>, a copy of the <83(b) Election>, attached as {Election Under Section 83(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986}.
