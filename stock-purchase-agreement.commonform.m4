Otherwise, <Accelerated Shares> will <Vest> immediately before the date of the <Acceleration Event>.

            \\ The exercise price of the <Repurchase Option> will be the <Original Price Per Share>, adjusted for any stock splits, stock dividends, and the like, multiplied by the number of <Unvested Shares> for which the <Repurchase Option> is exercised (the ""Repurchase Price"").

            \\ The <Repurchase Option> will expire at 23:59 San Francisco time on the date that is [Repurchase Option Days] calendar days after the date of <Termination> (the ""Repurchase Option Expiration Date"").

            \\ Unless the <Company> gives <Purchaser> notice that it does not intend to exercise its <Repurchase Option> for some or all <Unvested Shares> prior to the <Repurchase Option Expiration Date>, the <Company> will be deemed to exercise the <Repurchase Option> for all <Unvested Shares> on the <Repurchase Option Expiration Date> (""Automatic Repurchase""). The <Company> may give <Purchaser> notice that <Automatic Repurchase> will occur as of any earlier date, or for only some part of the <Unvested Shares>. On <Automatic Repurchase>, the <Company> will become the legal and beneficial owner of the <Unvested Shares> for which the <Repurchase Option> is exercised, will have all rights and interest in and related to those <Unvested Shares>, and will have the right to transfer them to its own name without further <Purchaser> action.

If requested by the <Company> or the underwriters, <Purchaser> shall enter into an agreement requested by the underwriters that reflects that restriction (a ""Lock-Up Agreement"").

    Escrow of Unvested Shares \\ For purposes of facilitating the enforcement of the provisions of {Limits on Transfer}, <Purchaser> agrees to deliver a Stock Power in the form attached to this <Agreement> as {Stock Power} signed by <Purchaser> and <Purchaser>'s spouse (if required for transfer), in blank, and such stock certificate(s), if any, to the Secretary of the <Company>, or the Secretary's designee, to hold such <Shares> (and stock certificate(s), if any) and Stock Power in escrow and to take all such actions and to effectuate all such transfers and/or releases as are required under this <Agreement>. <Purchaser> hereby acknowledges that the Secretary of the <Company>, or the Secretary's designee, is so appointed as the escrow holder with the these authorities as a material inducement to make this <Agreement> and that appointment is coupled with an interest and is accordingly irrevocable. <Purchaser> agrees that escrow holder will not be liable to any party to this <Agreement> (or to any other party). The escrow holder may rely on any letter, notice or other document with a signature purported to be genuine and may resign at any time. <Purchaser> agrees that if the Secretary of the <Company>, or the Secretary's designee, resigns as escrow holder for any reason, the <Board> will have the power to appoint a successor to serve as escrow holder under this <Agreement>.

    Investment and Taxation Representations \\ In connection with the purchase of the <Shares>, <Purchaser> represents to the <Company> the following:

        \\ <Purchaser> is aware of the <Company>'s business affairs and financial condition and has acquired enough information about the <Company> to reach an informed and knowledgeable decision to acquire the <Shares>. <Purchaser> is purchasing the <Shares> for investment for <Purchaser>'s own account only and not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, any "distribution" of the <Shares> within the meaning of the <Securities Act> or under state law. <Purchaser> does not have any present intent to transfer the <Shares> to any other person or entity.

        \\ <Purchaser> understands that the <Shares> have not been registered under the <Securities Act> by reason of a specific exemption therefrom, which exemption depends on, among other things, the honest and genuine nature of <Purchaser>'s investment intent as expressed in this <Agreement>.

        \\ <Purchaser> further acknowledges and understands that the securities must be held indefinitely unless they are later registered under the <Securities Act> or an exemption from such registration is available. <Purchaser> further acknowledges and understands that the <Company> is under no obligation to register the securities.

        Rule 144 \\ <Purchaser> is familiar with the provisions of Rule 144, promulgated under the <Securities Act>, which, in substance, allows limited public resale of "restricted securities" acquired, directly or indirectly, from the issuer of the securities (or from an affiliate of such issuer), in a non-public offering subject to the satisfaction of some conditions. <Purchaser> understands that the <Company> provides no assurances about whether he or she will be able to resell any or all the <Shares> under Rule 144, which rule requires, among other things, that the <Company> be subject to the reporting requirements of the <Exchange Act>, that resales of securities take place only after the holder of the <Shares> has held the <Shares> for given time periods, and under some circumstances, that resales of securities be limited in volume and take place only via brokered transactions.

        Burden of Proof \\ <Purchaser> further understands that if all the requirements of Rule 144 are not satisfied, registration under the <Securities Act>, compliance with Regulation A, or some other registration exemption will be required; and that, despite the fact that Rule 144 is not exclusive, the Staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission has expressed its opinion that those proposing to sell private placement securities other than in a registered offering and otherwise than under Rule 144 will have a substantial burden of proof in establishing that an exemption from registration is available for such offers or sales, and that such sellers and their respective brokers who participate in such transactions do so at their own risk.

        \\ <Purchaser> represents that <Purchaser> has reviewed, and is not subject to, any of the "Bad Actor" disqualifications described in Rule 506(d)(1)(i) through (viii) under the <Securities Act>.

        \\ <Purchaser> understands that <Purchaser> may suffer adverse tax consequences as a result of <Purchaser>'s purchase or disposition of the <Shares>. <Purchaser> represents that <Purchaser> has consulted any tax consultants <Purchaser> deems advisable in connection with the purchase or disposition of the <Shares> and that <Purchaser> is not relying on the <Company> for any tax advice.

    Restrictive Legends and Stop-Transfer Orders \\

        Legends \\ Any stock certificate or, in the case of uncertificated securities, any notice of issuance, for the <Covered Securities>, will bear the following legends (as well as any legends required by state and federal corporate and securities laws):

            Unregistered Securities Legend !! "The securities referenced herein have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, and have been acquired for investment and not with a view to, or in connection with, the sale or distribution thereof. No such sale or distribution may be effected without an effective registration statement related thereto or an opinion of counsel in a form satisfactory to the company that such registration is not required under the Securities Act of 1933."

            Transfer Restriction Legend !! "The securities referenced herein may be transferred only in accordance with the terms of an agreement between the company and the stockholder, a copy of which is on file with and may be obtained from the secretary of the company at no charge."

        Stop-Transfer Notices \\ <Purchaser> agrees that, to ensure compliance with the restrictions referred to in this <Agreement>, the <Company> may issue appropriate "stop transfer" instructions to its transfer agent, if any, and that, if the <Company> transfers its own securities, it may make appropriate notations to the same effect in its own stock ledger and list of shareholders.

        Refusal to Transfer \\ The <Company> will not be required

            \\ to transfer on its books any <Covered Securities> that have been sold or otherwise transferred in violation of any of the provisions of this <Agreement> or

            \\ to treat as owner of such <Covered Securities> or to accord the right to vote or pay dividends to any purchaser or other transferee to whom such <Covered Securities> will have been so transferred.

        Legend and Notice Removal \\ When all the following events have occurred, the <Covered Securities> then held by <Purchaser> will no longer be subject to the legend specified in {Transfer Restriction Legend} and the <Company> will remove any stop-transfer notices associated with the transfer restrictions imposed by this <Agreement>:

            \\ the termination of the <Right of First Refusal>;

            \\ the expiration or exercise in full of the <Repurchase Option>; and

            \\ the expiration or termination of the lock-up provisions of {Lock-up Agreement} (and of any agreement entered under {Lock-up Agreement}).

        After such time and on <Purchaser>'s request, a new stock certificate or, in the case of uncertificated securities, notice of issuance, for the remaining <Covered Securities>, shall be issued without the legend specified in {Transfer Restriction Legend} and delivered to <Purchaser>.

    Required Notices \\ <Purchaser> acknowledges that the <Covered Securities> are issued and will be held subject to all the provisions of {Restrictive Legends and Stop-Transfer Orders}, the Certificate of Incorporation and the Bylaws of the <Company> and any amendments to the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the <Company>, copies of which are on file at the principal office of the <Company>. A statement of all the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions granted to or imposed on the respective classes and/or series of shares of stock of the <Company> and on the holders of those classes and/or series may be obtained by any stockholder on request and without charge, at the principal office of the <Company>, and the <Company> will furnish any stockholder, on request and without charge, a copy of such statement. <Purchaser> acknowledges that the provisions of {Restrictive Legends and Stop-Transfer Orders} will constitute the notices required by Sections 151(f) and 202(a) of the Delaware General Corporation Law and the <Purchaser> hereby expressly waives the requirement of Section 151(f) of the Delaware General Corporation Law that it receive the written notice provided for in Sections 151(f) and 202(a) of the Delaware General Corporation Law within a reasonable time after the issuance of the <Covered Securities>.

    No Employment Rights \\ Nothing in this <Agreement> will affect in any manner whatsoever the right or power of the <Company>, or a parent, subsidiary or <Affiliate> of the <Company>, to terminate <Purchaser>'s employment or consulting relationship, for any reason, with or without cause.

    Section 83(b) Election \\

        \\ <Purchaser> understands that Section 83(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the ""Code""), taxes as ordinary income the difference between the amount paid for the <Shares> and the fair market value of the <Shares> as of the date any <restriction>s on the <Shares> lapse. In this context, ""restriction"" means the right of the <Company> to purchase the <Shares> back under the <Repurchase Option> described in {Vesting}. <Purchaser> understands that <Purchaser> may elect to be taxed when the <Shares> are purchased, rather than when and as the <Repurchase Option> expires, by filing an election under Section 83(b) (an ""83(b) Election"") of the <Code> with the Internal Revenue Service within 30 days from the date of purchase. Even if the fair market value of the <Shares> on entry into this <Agreement> equals the amount paid for the <Shares>, the election must be made to avoid income under Section 83(a) in the future. <Purchaser> understands that failure to file such an election on time may have bad tax consequences for <Purchaser>. <Purchaser> further understands that an additional copy of such election form should be filed with <Purchaser>'s federal income tax return for the calendar year in which the date of this <Agreement> falls. <Purchaser> acknowledges that this is only a summary of the effect of United States federal income taxation with respect to purchase of the <Shares> under this <Agreement>, does not purport to be complete, and is not intended or written to be used, and cannot be used, for the purposes of avoiding taxpayer penalties. <Purchaser> further acknowledges that the <Company> has directed <Purchaser> to seek independent advice regarding the provisions of the <Code>, the income tax laws of any municipality, state or foreign country in which <Purchaser> may reside, and the tax consequences of <Purchaser>'s death, and <Purchaser> has consulted, and has been fully advised by, <Purchaser>'s own tax advisor regarding such tax laws and tax consequences or has knowingly chosen not to consult such a tax advisor. <Purchaser> further acknowledges that neither the <Company> nor any subsidiary or representative of the <Company> has made any warranty or representation to <Purchaser> with respect to the tax consequences of <Purchaser>'s purchase of the <Shares> or of the making or failure to make an <83(b) Election>.

    !! <Purchaser> (and not the <Company>, its agents or any other person) will be solely responsible for appropriately filing such form with the IRS, even if <Purchaser> requests the <Company>, its agents or any other person make this filing on <Purchaser>'s behalf.

    \\ <Purchaser> agrees that <Purchaser> will sign and deliver to the <Company> with this <Agreement> a copy of the acknowledgment and statement attached as {Acknowledgment and Statement of Decision Regarding Section 83(b) Election} and, if <Purchaser> decides to make an <83(b) Election>, a copy of the <83(b) Election>, attached as {Election Under Section 83(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986}.
